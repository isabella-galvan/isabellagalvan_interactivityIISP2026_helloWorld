    <p> In my daily life, I work at an art studio helping to teach children's classes. </p>
  
  <p> My main resolution for 2026 is to read more books. 
    <br> I recently finished reading <i>Twilight</i> by Stephanie Meyer.</p>

    <p>My favorite website is Pinterest. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/homefeed/" target="_blank">Visit Pinterest</a></p>
